# Loggy v1.0.0

Loggy provides snippets for developers who prefer old-school debugging.

## Features

Loggy assists printing name, data type and value of any variable.

> Tip: Loggy is an open-source program. We'd appreciate contributions to support other programming languages too as our goal is to cover all the languages that VS Code supports :smile:

## Languages Supported

- JavaScript

## Usage

1. Open any supported file and start typing `loggy`.
2. There's multi-cursor support for you to type in the variable's name.
3. Press `tab` twice to continue coding.
4. That's all. :smile:

## Release Notes

This is literally the first release so nothing much yet.

### 1.0.0

- Initial release of Loggy
- Supports `JavaScript` files
